Codex Intercom adds local messaging between Codex, Pi, and other coding-agent
sessions on the same machine. It speaks the same local broker protocol as
`pi-intercom`, so sessions can discover each other, send updates, ask blocking
questions, read pending messages, and reply to asks.

The project has two related pieces:

- `codex-intercom-mcp`: an MCP server that exposes intercom tools inside a
  normal Codex session.
- `coi`: a wakeable Codex sidecar launcher. It starts a Codex app-server,
  registers an intercom identity, and starts Codex turns when another session
  sends it work.

Use plain MCP when you only need tools inside an already-active Codex turn. Use
`coi` when you want another session to wake the worker automatically.

## Status

Preview. This is the Codex-side adapter split out of `pi-intercom`.

Plain Codex MCP sessions do not receive Pi-style unsolicited visible turns.
Incoming messages are queued while the MCP server is running; call
`intercom_pending` to read them. Wake-on-message workflows require `coi` or the
app-server bridge.

## Install

For normal use, install the package so the command-line entry points are on
`PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g github:dataforxyz/codex-intercom
```

This provides:

- `codex-intercom-mcp`
- `codex-intercom-bridge`
- `coi`

Then add the MCP server to Codex:

```bash
codex mcp add codex-intercom -- codex-intercom-mcp
```

Optional MCP identity variables can be attached at registration time:

```bash
codex mcp add codex-planner \
  --env CODEX_INTERCOM_NAME=planner \
  --env CODEX_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID=codex-planner \
  --env CODEX_INTERCOM_MODEL=codex \
  -- codex-intercom-mcp
```

Per-command environment variables passed to `codex exec` are not forwarded into
the MCP server process. Configure identity on the MCP server entry when you need
stable names or IDs.

## Plugin Use

This repo also includes Codex plugin metadata:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json`
- `skills/codex-intercom/SKILL.md`

The plugin packages the MCP server and the optional intercom skill. It is useful
when you want Codex to install and manage the intercom integration as a plugin.
For a deliberately minimal profile, prefer direct MCP configuration with
`codex-intercom-mcp`; that lets you disable plugins and skills while keeping the
intercom tools.

## Tools

- `intercom_whoami`: show this session's intercom ID, name, cwd, and model.
- `intercom_status`: show connection status and pending message counts.
- `intercom_list`: list local Pi and Codex sessions.
- `intercom_set_summary`: publish a short discoverable status.
- `intercom_send`: send a non-blocking message.
- `intercom_ask`: send a question and wait for the target's reply.
- `intercom_pending`: read queued inbound messages and unresolved asks.
- `intercom_reply`: reply to a pending inbound ask.

Example:

```typescript
intercom_list({ scope: "machine" })

intercom_ask({
  to: "worker-a",
  message: "Please inspect the failing test and reply with the likely cause.",
  timeout_ms: 45000
})
```

Blocking asks default to a short bounded wait and reject waits over 120 seconds.
For longer work, use `intercom_send` and check later with `intercom_pending`.

## Wakeable Workers With `coi`

`coi` starts a per-agent Codex app-server socket, registers an intercom sidecar
for that socket, creates or resumes the sidecar's app-server thread, then
launches an interactive Codex UI attached to the same socket and thread.

Start a named worker:

```bash
coi --name worker-a --id worker-a
```

Useful flags:

```bash
coi --name api-worker --id api-worker
coi --cwd /path/to/project --instructions "Reply tersely. Ask before destructive changes."
coi --no-tui --name background-worker --id background-worker
```

Everything not recognized as a sidecar flag is passed through to
`codex resume --remote`, so normal Codex flags still work. Prompt arguments are
placed after the resumed sidecar thread ID.

`coi` also applies Codex runtime flags such as `--sandbox`,
`--ask-for-approval`, and `--add-dir` to wake-triggered sidecar turns. For
example, `coi --name worker-a --id worker-a --sandbox workspace-write` lets
intercom-woken turns write inside the worker workspace instead of falling back
to read-only.

The sidecar inherits `CODEX_HOME`, which makes it useful with a normal Codex
home or a dedicated minimal home.

## Minimal Wakeable Profile

A minimal profile is useful for workers that should stay focused on code and
coordination. It reduces prompt/tool surface area by isolating the worker from
your normal Codex config, memories, plugins, browser surfaces, image generation,
and extra skills. Keep goals and multi-agent support on so the worker can track
the task and delegate subtasks.

Create a dedicated Codex home:

```bash
export CODEX_MIN_HOME="$HOME/.codex-min-intercom"
mkdir -p "$CODEX_MIN_HOME"
```

`$CODEX_MIN_HOME/config.toml`:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
web_search = "disabled"

[features]
apps = false
memories = false
web_search = false
web_search_cached = false
web_search_request = false

# Keep the core coding-agent surface.
goals = true
multi_agent = true
shell_tool = true
unified_exec = true
auto_compaction = true
tool_call_mcp_elicitation = true

# Disable optional/distraction-heavy surfaces.
browser_use = false
browser_use_external = false
browser_use_full_cdp_access = false
in_app_browser = false
computer_use = false
image_generation = false
plugins = false
plugin_sharing = false
tool_suggest = false
skill_mcp_dependency_install = false
hooks = false
workspace_dependencies = false

[mcp_servers.codex-intercom]
command = "codex-intercom-mcp"
```

After the first launch, Codex may populate system skills under the alternate
home. To keep the profile minimal without deleting anything, list the skill
paths:

```bash
find "$CODEX_MIN_HOME/skills" -name SKILL.md -print
```

For each skill you want disabled, add a config entry:

```toml
[[skills.config]]
path = "/absolute/path/from/find/SKILL.md"
enabled = false
```

There is no required alias name. A short alias such as `cim` keeps the minimal
worker easy to launch:

```bash
cim() {
  local home="${CODEX_MIN_HOME:-$HOME/.codex-min-intercom}"
  local yolo="${CODEX_YOLO:-1}"
  case "${1:-}" in
    yolo|--yolo|on) shift; yolo=1 ;;
    safe|--safe|off) shift; yolo=0 ;;
  esac
  local args=(--name codex-min)
  [ "$yolo" = 1 ] && args+=(--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox)
  CODEX_HOME="$home" coi "${args[@]}" "$@"
}
```

This alias intentionally defaults the minimal worker to yolo mode: no approval
prompts and no filesystem sandbox. Use it only for workers you trust with the
current machine account, or remove the bypass flag when you want a safer
workspace-scoped worker. Use `cim safe ...` or set `CODEX_YOLO=0` to launch
without the bypass flag.

Use it like:

```bash
cim --name worker-a --id worker-a
cim --name reviewer --id reviewer --instructions "Review only; do not edit files."
cim --no-tui --name background-worker --id background-worker
cim safe --name safe-worker --id safe-worker --sandbox workspace-write
```

If you are developing this repository from a checkout instead of installing the
package, build and link it:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

Or point an alias directly at the checkout:

```bash
cim() {
  local home="${CODEX_MIN_HOME:-$HOME/.codex-min-intercom}"
  local repo="${CODEX_INTERCOM_REPO:-/absolute/path/to/codex-intercom}"
  local yolo="${CODEX_YOLO:-1}"
  case "${1:-}" in
    yolo|--yolo|on) shift; yolo=1 ;;
    safe|--safe|off) shift; yolo=0 ;;
  esac
  local args=(--name codex-min)
  [ "$yolo" = 1 ] && args+=(--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox)
  CODEX_HOME="$home" node "$repo/dist/coi.mjs" "${args[@]}" "$@"
}
```

## Manager And Worker Pattern

Use one Codex session as the manager and one or more `coi` sessions as wakeable
workers. The manager keeps the task shaped, feeds work to workers, watches for
drift, and decides when the work is ready to finish.

Example worker launch in `tmux`:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s worker-a 'cd /path/to/project && cim --name worker-a --id worker-a'
```

Then ask the worker from the manager session:

```typescript
intercom_ask({
  to: "worker-a",
  message: "Please create a goal for the task, inspect the handoff, and report your first plan.",
  timeout_ms: 45000
})
```

Recommended manager prompt:

```text
Start a wakeable worker in tmux using the minimal intercom alias:

  tmux new-session -d -s <worker-id> 'cd <repo> && cim --name <worker-id> --id <worker-id>'

Give the worker a FEAT.md-style handoff:

# FEAT: <short task name>
Objective: <what must be true when done>
Context: <repo, branch, issue, constraints, important files>
Approach: <suggested first steps, but allow the worker to adjust>
Verification: <commands/tests/checks that should pass>
Definition of done: <clear finish criteria>
Coordination: create a goal, use subagents when useful, keep the manager updated through intercom, ask before risky or broad changes, and keep work in a branch/worktree when appropriate.

Tell the worker to create and maintain its own goal, use agents for parallel investigation or review, and report blockers early. As manager, keep sending focused follow-up work through intercom, keep the worker on task, and handle PR or final handoff when the implementation is ready.
```

For non-blocking delegation, use `intercom_send` and check back later. For a
decision the manager needs before continuing, use `intercom_ask`.

## App-Server Bridge

Use `codex-intercom-bridge` when you want one process to publish one or more
configured virtual Codex workers without launching an interactive TUI for each
worker.

Create a bridge config:

```json
{
  "statePath": "/home/you/.pi/agent/intercom/codex-bridge-state.json",
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "codex-worker",
      "name": "codex-worker",
      "cwd": "/home/you/src/project",
      "model": "gpt-5.5",
      "instructions": "Reply concisely. Ask before making destructive changes."
    }
  ]
}
```

Start it:

```bash
codex-intercom-bridge --config /home/you/.pi/agent/intercom/codex-bridge.json
```

Then other local sessions can target `codex-worker` with `intercom_send` or
`intercom_ask`. The bridge stores each worker's app-server `threadId` in
`statePath`, so later messages continue the same Codex thread.

By default, bridge turns run with `approvalPolicy: "never"` and read-only,
network-disabled sandboxing. Override `approvalPolicy` or `sandboxPolicy` in
the agent config only when you explicitly want a background worker to have more
authority.

## Development

Clone and run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataforxyz/codex-intercom.git
cd codex-intercom
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

For MCP development, register the TypeScript source directly:

```bash
codex mcp add codex-intercom-dev -- npx --no-install tsx ./codex/server.ts
```

Use either the built install or the dev install in a given Codex profile.
Running both at the same time can register duplicate intercom MCP tools.

## Relationship To Pi Intercom

`pi-intercom` remains the Pi-native extension with overlays, inline rendering,
and Pi `triggerTurn` delivery. `codex-intercom` is the Codex MCP/plugin adapter
plus wake-on-message Codex app-server sidecars.

For now this repository vendors the minimal local broker/client protocol for
compatibility. If the protocol stabilizes across multiple adapters, the shared
parts should move into a small core package.
