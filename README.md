# Codex Intercom

Codex MCP plugin for direct local messaging with Pi and Codex coding-agent
sessions on the same machine.

Codex Intercom speaks the same local broker protocol as `pi-intercom`, so Codex
sessions can list Pi sessions, send direct messages, ask blocking questions,
check pending inbound messages, and reply to pending asks.

## Status

Preview. This is the Codex-side adapter split out of `pi-intercom`.

Codex MCP does not currently provide Pi-style unsolicited turn wake-up. Incoming
messages are queued while this MCP server is running; call `intercom_pending`
to read unread messages and unresolved asks.

For wake-on-message workflows, run the app-server bridge daemon. It publishes
configured virtual Codex workers as intercom sessions. Messages sent to those
workers create or resume Codex app-server threads and start a turn; blocking
asks are answered with the worker's final assistant message.

## Tools

- `intercom_whoami`
- `intercom_status`
- `intercom_list`
- `intercom_set_summary`
- `intercom_send`
- `intercom_ask`
- `intercom_pending`
- `intercom_reply`

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataforxyz/codex-intercom.git
cd codex-intercom
npm install
codex mcp add codex-intercom -- npx --no-install tsx ./codex/server.ts
```

Optional identity variables:

```bash
CODEX_INTERCOM_NAME=planner
CODEX_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID=codex-planner
CODEX_INTERCOM_MODEL=codex
```

When Codex launches the MCP server, those variables must be configured on the
MCP server itself. Per-command variables passed to `codex exec` are not
forwarded into the MCP server process.

```bash
codex mcp add codex-planner \
  --env CODEX_INTERCOM_NAME=planner \
  --env CODEX_INTERCOM_SESSION_ID=codex-planner \
  -- npx --no-install tsx /absolute/path/to/codex-intercom/codex/server.ts
```

For ad hoc multi-Codex runs, the easiest discovery flow is to have the receiver
call `intercom_set_summary` with a unique role or token, then have the sender
call `intercom_list` and target the matching session ID.

## Codex Plugin

This repo includes Codex plugin metadata:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json`
- `skills/codex-intercom/SKILL.md`

The plugin runs the MCP server with:

```bash
npx --no-install tsx ./codex/server.ts
```

That means a local checkout currently needs `npm install` before Codex starts
the MCP server.

## App-Server Bridge

Use the bridge when the receiver should not have to keep an interactive Codex
turn open just to notice messages.

Create a bridge config:

```json
{
  "statePath": "/home/you/.pi/agent/intercom/codex-bridge-state.json",
  "agents": [
    {
      "id": "codex-worker",
      "name": "codex-worker",
      "cwd": "/home/you/src/project",
      "model": "gpt-5.5",
      "instructions": "Reply concisely. Ask before making destructive changes."
    }
  ]
}
```

Start it:

```bash
npm run codex:bridge -- --config /home/you/.pi/agent/intercom/codex-bridge.json
```

Then other local sessions can target `codex-worker` with `intercom_send` or
`intercom_ask`. The bridge stores each worker's app-server `threadId` in
`statePath`, so later messages continue the same Codex thread.

By default, bridge turns run with `approvalPolicy: "never"` and read-only,
network-disabled sandboxing. Override `approvalPolicy` or `sandboxPolicy` in
the agent config only when you explicitly want a background worker to have more
authority.

The bridge defaults to spawning `codex app-server` directly over JSONL stdio.
For a separately managed app-server socket, use Unix WebSocket transport:

```json
{
  "appServer": {
    "transport": "unix-websocket",
    "socketPath": "/home/you/.pi/agent/intercom/codex.sock"
  },
  "agents": [
    { "id": "codex-worker", "cwd": "/home/you/src/project" }
  ]
}
```

Start that socket separately with:

```bash
codex app-server --listen unix:///home/you/.pi/agent/intercom/codex.sock
```

## Examples

List sessions:

```typescript
intercom_list({ scope: "machine" })
```

Send a non-blocking update:

```typescript
intercom_send({
  to: "worker",
  message: "I found the failing test. Check src/api/client.test.ts."
})
```

Ask and wait:

```typescript
intercom_ask({
  to: "planner",
  message: "Should retry apply only to idempotent endpoints?",
  timeout_ms: 120000
})
```

Check and reply:

```typescript
intercom_pending({ mark_read: false })
intercom_reply({ message: "Use GET/PUT/DELETE only, max 3 retries." })
```

Two-Codex handoff pattern:

```typescript
// Receiver
intercom_set_summary({ summary: "worker: retry tests" })
intercom_pending({ mark_read: true })

// Sender
intercom_list({ scope: "machine", include_self: true })
intercom_send({
  to: "codex-session-id-from-list",
  message: "Retry tests are ready; please check the pending failure."
})
```

Wake an app-server-backed virtual worker:

```typescript
intercom_ask({
  to: "codex-worker",
  message: "Please inspect the latest failing test and reply with the likely cause.",
  timeout_ms: 120000
})
```

## `coi` Sidecar Launcher

`coi` starts a per-agent Codex app-server socket, registers an intercom sidecar
for that socket, creates or resumes the sidecar's app-server thread, then
launches an interactive Codex UI attached to that same socket and thread.

```bash
npm run coi -- --profile cliproxy
```

Build or link the installable command:

```bash
npm run build
npm link
coi --profile cliproxy
```

Useful sidecar flags:

```bash
npm run coi -- --name api-worker --id api-worker --profile cliproxy
npm run coi -- --cwd /home/you/src/project --instructions "Reply tersely."
npm run coi -- --no-tui --name smoke-worker
```

Everything not recognized as a sidecar flag is passed through to `codex
resume --remote`, so existing profile/model/sandbox flags still work. Prompt
arguments are placed after the resumed sidecar thread id. The sidecar inherits
`CODEX_HOME`, which means it can be used from either a normal Codex environment
or an alternate one such as `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-alt`.

Current limitation: the sidecar can be messaged while the `coi` process is
running and will wake an app-server-backed Codex turn. It does not make every
ordinary `codex` process wakeable; launch the agent through `coi` when you want
this behavior. Blocking asks can set `timeout_ms`; sidecar asks default to 120
seconds. Sidecar-originated intercom sends are capped per turn and per minute to
prevent unattended ping-pong loops.

## Relationship To Pi Intercom

`pi-intercom` remains the Pi-native extension with overlays, inline rendering,
and Pi `triggerTurn` delivery. `codex-intercom` is the Codex MCP/plugin
adapter plus an optional Codex app-server bridge for wake-on-message virtual
workers.

For now this repository vendors the minimal local broker/client protocol for
compatibility. If the protocol stabilizes across multiple adapters, the shared
parts should move into a small core package.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```
